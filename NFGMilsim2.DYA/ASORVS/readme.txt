ASOR Vehicle Selector v1.4

Installation instructions:
Include the following in your description.ext file:
#include "ASORVS\menu.hpp"
class CfgFunctions
{
	#include "ASORVS\cfgfunctions.hpp"
};


To open the vehicle selector, 'execvm' asorvs\open.sqf. Parameters are as follows:
	1 - Vehicle Types (Array of Strings). Can include "cars", "tanks", "helicopters", "planes" and/or "boats".
2 - Whitelist for this vehicle selector (Array of Strings). If this array isn't empty, allow only the class names specified.
3 - Spawn Marker (String). Name of the marker where the vehicle should be spawned. Nearby vehicles will be removed beforehand.
4 - Vehicle Height (Optional Number/Scalar, default 0). Height (Position format) for the vehicle to spawn ( so you can spawn them in/on buildings ).
5 - Spawn Radius (Optional Number/Scalar, default 5). Radius around the spawn point to clear before spawning the vehicle.

Examples of actions that can be placed on any object are as follows:
//Spawn any helicopters on the "chopperspawn" marker.
this addAction ["Spawn Helicopters" {[["helicopters"], [], "chopperspawn"] execvm "ASORVS\open.sqf";}];

//Spawn only B_MBT_01_mlrs_F and B_MBT_01_cannon_F on the "tankspawn" marker.
this addAction ["Spawn Tanks", {[["tanks"], ["B_MBT_01_mlrs_F", "B_MBT_01_cannon_F"], "tankspawn"] execvm "ASORVS\open.sqf";}];

Set up any settings you want (including blacklist) in ASORVS\config.sqf.
